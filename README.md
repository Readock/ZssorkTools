# ZssorkTools

Collection of scripts that i use for my painting workflow in Krita.

- Toggle Primary/Secondary Brush (F)
  - Configure brushes in settings dialog
  - _Note: I use it to quickly change between hard round and airbrush (because ten brush script feels a bit clumsy sometimes and this is only one simple button press)_
- Toggle Opacity (D)
  - On: Sets opacity to 100%
  - Off: Switch to previous opacity
- Line tool (SHIFT)
  - Quickly change to line tool with one button press (similar to photoshop)
  - Option to keep current opacity settings as well for convenience
- Smart Toggle Pressure (Y)
  - On: Sets opacity to 100% and activates pressure
  - Off: Deactivate pressure and switch to previous opacity 
  - _Note: with pressure sensitivity I always want 100% opacity as well_
- Increase/Decrease Brush Size
  - Modifies the brush size (C/V)
  - _Note: the default Krita actions are constant and not proportional to current brush size_
- Increase/Decrease Opacity
  - Modifies the opacity (A/S)
  - _Note: configurable modifier_

> I also use the [Separate Brush and Eraser](https://github.com/ollyisonit/krita-separate-brush-eraser) plugin
